<H3>API overview 
</H3>
<P>The fftMPI library has 4 classes: FFT3d, FFT2d, Remap3d, Remap2d.  The
FFT classes perform 3d and 2d FFTs.  The Remap classes rearrange the
data in distributed 3d and 2d arrays across processors.  They can be
used if you want to only rearrange data, but not perform an FFT.
</P>
<P>For the fftMPI library, an FFT is defined by these attributes:
</P>
<P>an MPI communicator for the P processors that own the data and compute the FFT
a handful of settings which determine how the FFT is computed
an initial and final tiling of the grid (3d or 2d) across the P processors
</P>
<P>Once these attributes are defined, any number of forward or inverse
FFTs can be performed on one or more data arrays.  If needed, multiple
FFTs can be instantiated, each with different attributes.
</P>
<P>These are the library calls that perform these operations:
</P>
<P><A HREF = "api_create.html">FFT constructor and destructor</A> = takes an MPI
comunicator as arg
</P>
<UL><LI><A HREF = "api_create.html">instantiate the FFT class</A>
<LI><A HREF = "api_setup.html">setup the FFT</A>
<LI><A HREF = "api_compute.html">compute one or more FFTs</A>
<LI><A HREF = "api_create.html">destruct the FFT class</A> 
</UL>
<P>The <A HREF = "api_setup.html">setup methods</A> include
</P>
<P>The basic way to use either of the FFT classes is to instantiate the
class and call setup() once to define how the FFT grid is distributed
across processors for both input to and output from the FFT.  You then
invoke the compute() method as many times as needed to perform forward
and/or inverse FFTs.  Destruct the class when you are done using it.
</P>
<P>If a different size FFT or different grid distribution is needed, you
can instantiate the FFT class as many times as needed.  A similar
procedure holds for the Remap classes, where the remap() method
replaces compute().
</P>
<P>The choice to operate on single versus double precision data must be
made at compile time, as explained on the <A HREF = "">Compiling the library</A>
page.
</P>
<P>These are the methods that can be called for either the FFT3d or FFT2d
classes:

<P>See the test3d.cpp, test3d_c.cpp, test3d_f90.f90, test3d.py files in
the test dir for examples of how all these methods are called.
Ditto for the test2d.cpp, test2d_c.cpp, test2d_f90.f90, test2d.py files.
