<H3>API overview 
</H3>
<P>The fftMPI library is a collection of 4 classes: FFT3d, FFT2d,
Remap3d, Remap2d.  The 2 FFT classes perform 3d and 2d FFTs.  The 2
Remap classes perform data rearrangments in parallel.  Only call them
if you don't wish to perform FFTs, but just rearrange the data in 3d
or 2d grids.
</P>
<P>A calling program can instantiate any of them, as
many times as it wishes.
</P>
<P>Idea is instatiate once, setup() once to defines intial/final tiling,
then use multiple times to perform either forward/backward FFTs.
</P>
<P>Forward goes from initial tiling -> final.
Backward goes from final tiling -> initial.
</P>
<P>If need different pairing of intiial/final tiling, just
instantiate a separate FFT
</P>
<P>Single/double has to be chosen at compile time, as explained on build page.
</P>
<P>Data for FFT grid is owned by caller, must be contiguous as explained
"here".
</P>
<P>These are the methods that can be called for either the FFT3d or FFT2d
classes:

the test dir for examples of how all these methods are called.
Ditto for the test2d.cpp, test2d_c.cpp, test2d_f90.f90, test2d.py files.
