</H2></CENTER>
<P>6 Mar 2018 version
</P>
<P>The Parallel FFT library is designed to perform 2d and 3d
complex-to-complex Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) efficiently on
distributed-memory parallel computers using the message passing
interface (MPI) library.

<P>The fftMPI library was developed by Steve Plimpton at Sandia National
Laboratories with help from several collaborators, listed below.

<P>My thanks to Bruce Hendrickson and Sue Minkoff at Sandia for useful
discussions about parallel FFT strategies and to the FFTW authors for
the idea of using "plans" as an object-oriented tool for hiding FFT
and remap details from the user.
