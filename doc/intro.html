<H3>Introduction 
</H3>
<P>The fftMPI library computes multi-dimensional FFTs in parallel where
the FFT grid is distributed across processors.  Features and
limitations of the library are as follows:

<P>In the fftMPI context, a "tiling" of the 2d or 3d grid is a
decomposition of the N1xN2 or N1xN2xN3 grid into P tiles, where P is
the number of MPI tasks (processors).  Each tile is a dense
"rectangle" of grid points in 2d or "brick" in 3d.  Each processor's
tile can be any size or shape, including empty.  The P tiles cannot
overlap; their union is the entire grid.
</P>
<P>A 2d FFT is performed as a set of 1d FFTs in the x dimension, followed
by 1d FFTs in y.  A 3d FFT is the same, with a final stage of 1d FFTs
in z.  As noted above, the 1d FFTs are not computed by fftMPI, but
rather by calls on each processor to a library that computes optimized
1d FFTs.  What fftMPI encodes is the parallel communication necessary
to move data between processors and re-order on each processor, so as
to enable the global set of 1d FFTs to be distributed across
processors successively for each dimension, where the data for each 1d
FFT is stored contiguously by a single processor.
</P>
<P>The fftMPI library can be used to only communicate and rearrange the
data in a 2d or 3d grid in parallel, without performing 1d FFTs.  This
"remap" operation can be used, for example, to transpose a distributed
2d matrix or 3d tensor.  In this case, an initial and final
decomposition (tiling) is specified, as well as which dimensions of
stored grid data (x,y,z) vary fastest to slowest in contiguous memory
for the final tiling.

<P>The fftMPI library was developed at Sandia National Laboratories, a US
Department of Energy facility, with funding from the DOE. It is an
open-source code, distributed freely under the terms of the BSD Public
License (BSD).  See the LICENSE file in the distribution.

<P>The primary author of this package is Steve Plimpton, who can be
contacted at sjplimp at sandia.gov.  This <A HREF = "http://www.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/download.html">download

version of this package can be downloaded.

<P>This library is designed for distributed-memory parallel machines
using MPI.  The library only performs the data movement tasks
necessary to compute multi-dimensional FFTs in parallel; the
transforms themselves are computed by on-processor 1d FFT routines
provided by vendors or the freely available FFTW package.  The data
remapping routines can also be called directly (independent of the
FFTs) to change the layout of 2d or 3d arrays across processors.
</P>
<P>The library is written in C++, but a C-style library interface is
provided, along with Fortran and Python wrappers.  So the library can
be called by C++ or C or any language that interfaces with C,
e.g. Fortran or Python.
</P>
<P>The library should run on any parallel machine that supports MPI.  It
also works with any size 2d or 3d arrays, so long as the native 1d FFT
routines support the array dimensions.  It can be run on any number of
processors, including in serial. The library allows considerable
flexibility in the choice of initial and final data layout of the FFT
grid across processors.
