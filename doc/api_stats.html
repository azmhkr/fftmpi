<H3>API for FFT only_1d_ffts(), only_remaps(), only_one_remap() 
</H3>
<P>These methods are generally only useful for performance testing or
debugging.  They perform low-level operations within the FFT.  See the
test/test3d.cpp and its timing() method for examples of how they can be
accessed and output.
</P>
<P>The code examples at the bottom of the page are for 3d FFTs.  Just
replace "3d" by "2d" for 2d FFTs.  Note that a few of the variables
listed in the API section do not exist for 2d FFTs.

<P>The 3 "only" methods perform only portions of an FFT, so that they can
be timed seperately by the calling app.  The "in" and "out" pointers
have the same meaning as for the <A HREF = "api_compute.html">compute() method</A>.
The data they point to should be initialized to zero by the caller.
</P>
<P>For only_1d_ffts(), 3 sets of 1d ffts (fast, mid, slow) are performed
if the 3d case, and 2 sets for 2d (just fast, slow).  No data
remapping is performed.  Only an "in" buffer is passed to this method,
since the 1d FFTs are always done in place.  Since a processor may own
more data at intermediate stages of the FFT than it does initially,
the data buffer should be of size "fftsize" and all be initialized to
zero.  Fftsize is the buffer length returned by the <A HREF = "api_setup.html">setup()
method</A> or <A HREF = "tune.html">tune() method</A>.
</P>
<P>For only_remaps(), all the data remappings for the FFT are performed,
but no 1d FFTs.  The flag value is 1 for a forward FFT and -1 for an
inverse FFT, the same as the flag value for the <A HREF = "api_compute.html">compute()
method</A>.
</P>
<P>For only_one_remap(), a single data remappings within the FFT is
performed (no 1d FFTs).  The flag value is 1 for a forward FFT and -1
for an inverse FFT.  The "which" argument is one of 1,2,3,4 for a 3d
FFT, and one of 1,2,3 for a 2d FFT.  For a forward 3d FFT, 1 = initial
remap from input layout to x-pencils, 2 = remap from x to y-pencils, 3
= remap from y to z-pencils, 4 = remap from z-pencils to output
layout.  For an inverse 3d FFT each of the which = 1,2,3,4 is the
same, except the remap is in the other direction.  E.g. which = 3 is a
remap from z to y-pencils.  A 2d FFT is the same except there is no y
to z-pencils remap for a forward FFT.
</P>
<P>The variable lines in the API section above are names of public
variables within the FFT class which can be accessed by the caller.
Their data types are one of the following: int (32-bit integer),
int64_t (64-bit integer), double (64-bit floating point), char *
(string), int *, double *.  The latter two are vectors of values.
</P>
<P>The collective,exchange,packflag values are set by the caller (or
defaults) when using the <A HREF = "api_setup.html">setup() method</A> They are set
by fftMPI when using the <A HREF = "api_tune.html">tune() method</A>.  Memusage is
the size (on each processor) of the internal memory allocated by
fftMPI for send and receive buffers.
</P>
<P>The 4 lines of variables that begin with "np" are info about the
processor decompositions of the global FFT grid at different stages of
the FFT.  Fast, mid, slow refer to the x, y, z-pencil decompositions
between stages of 1d FFTs.  Brick refer to a 3d brick (or 2d
rectangle) decomposition which is used when exchange = 1 (brick).
See the <A HREF = "api_setup.html">setup() method</A> doc page for details.
</P>
<P>The large set of variables begining is output generated by the <A HREF = "api_tune.html">tune()
method</A>.  Refer to its doc page for details on trials
and FFTs/trial (npertrial).  The various input flags and timing
outputs for each trial are stored in vectors.
