<H3>API for FFT compute() 
</H3>
<P>This method is called as many times as desired to perform
forward and inverse FFTs.
</P>
<P>Flag is set to 1 for forward FFTs and to -1 for inverse FFTs.  In and
out are the FFT array data allocated by the caller.  If in = out, an
in-place FFT is performed.  The size of the pointer should be
allocated to the fftsize value returned by setup(), even if that is
larger than the input or output data size.  If in != out, then "in"
only need be large enough for the initial data owned by the processor,
but "out" should be allocated to the fftsize value returned by
setup().
</P>
<P>As discussed in the <A HREF = "#data">Data layout</A> section, in and out are
effectively pointers to 1d vectors of contiguous memory.  For
double-precision FFTs, FFT_SCALAR is a typedef to a "double".  For
single-precision FFTs, FFT_SCALAR is a typedef to a "float".  So the
caller can pass a double * or float * pointer directly.
