Compiling the library :h3

From the src directory, simply type 

make :pre

This should build the library, so long as you have MPI installed and
available in your path.  The standard Makefile uses mpicxx for
compiling and linking.  The resulting library file is libfft.a.
There are also several Makefile.machine files provided that
work on different machines.  You can use one of them or
created your own edited file and invoke it as

make -f Makefile.machine :pre

You should only need to edit the "compiler/linker settings"
section at the top of the Makefile.

There are 2 options that can be set via the make command, via
the "fft" and/or "p" variables:

make fft=FFT1d p=PRECISION :pre

The "fft" variable determines which 1d FFT library is used.  The
options for "FFT1d" are FFTW, FFTW3, FFTW2, MKL, or KISS, in either
lower- or upper-case.  FFTW is the same as FFTW3.  KISS is the
default, if "fft" is not specified.

If you specify FFTW2 or FFTW3 or MKL the Makefile assumes the
directories for their respective include files are in your path.
These files are fftw.h or sfftw.h for double/single precision for
FFTW2, fftw3.h for FFTW3, and mkl_dfti.h for MKL.  The KISS library
(kissfft.h) is included in the src dir.

If the appropriate include file is not found, you will need to add a
setting for the directory to FFT_INC in the Makefile, something like
-I/home/me/include.

The "p" variable determines whether double or single precision FFTs
are performed.  The options for PRECISION are single or double, in
either lower- or upper-case.  Double is the default, if "p" is not
specified.
