<H3>Using the library from your program 
</H3>
<P>The discussion in this section and the following C++, C, Fortran
sections assumes the program is performing 3d FFTs.  Just change 3d to
2d for programs that perform 2d FFTs.
</P>
<P>To use the Parallel FFT library from any program (C++, C, Fortran) the
following steps are necessary.
</P>
<UL><LI>Link the program with the Parallel FFT library in src/libfft.a and
also with the 1d FFT library that corresponds to the settings made for
1d FFTs and precision (double vs single) when the FFT library was
built.  The latter may require a -Ldir setting in the link command.


<LI>Insure that the precision of data allocation for FFT grids matches the
precision setting (double vs single) used when the FFT library was
built.  As discussed above in the <A HREF = "#data">Data layout</A> section, this
means allocation of doubles for double precision FFTs (2 doubles per
complex value) and allocation of floats for single precision
FFTs. 
</UL>
<P>To use the Parallel FFT library from a C++ program, the following
additional steps are necessary.  See the test/test3d.cpp file as an
example:
</P>
<UL><LI>Include src/fft3d.h in program files which instantiate or call methods
from the FFT3d class.  The compilation of these files will need to be
able to find the include file used by the 1d FFT library specified
when the library was built.  This may require a -Idir setting in the
compile command. 

<LI>Add the line "using namespace FFT_NS;" at the top of the same program
files. 

<LI>See the section <A HREF = "#syntax_c++">Syntax for calling the library from C++</A>
below for specifics of how to make library calls from C++. 
</UL>
<P>To use the Parallel FFT library from a C program, the following
additional steps are necessary.  See the test/test3d_c.c file as an
example:
</P>
<UL><LI>Include src/fftlib.h in program files which call methods from the
library C-interface. 

<LI>Insure the pointer returned from fft3d_create() is stored in an 8-byte
variable (void * pointer) by the program.  This pointer is passed in
all subsequent calls to the library. 
</UL>
<P>To use the Parallel FFT library from a Fortran program, the following
additional steps are necessary.  See the test/test3d_f90.f90 file as
an example:
</P>
<UL><LI>Insure the pointer returned from fft3d_create() is stored in an 8-byte
variable (integer or floating point) by the program. This pointer is
passed in all subsequent calls to the library. 
</UL>
<P>A calling program can instantiate any of the classes, as many times as
it wishes.
