Running the test programs :h3

The test programs illustrate how to use the Parallel FFT library.
They also enable testing and benchmarking of all the options the
library supports.  These options are specified via command-line
arguments, all of which have default values, as indicated below.  All
of the programs can be launched serially (one processor) or via mpirun
on multiple processors.

Here are examples:

test3d -g 100 100 100 -n 50
test3d_c -g 100 100 100 -n 50 -m 1
mpirun -np 8 test3d_f90 -g 100 100 100 -n 50
mpirun -np 16 test2d -g 1000 2000 -n 100
mpirun -np 4 test2d_c -g 500 500 -n 1000 -i 492893 -v
test2d_f90 -g 256 256 -n 1000 :pre

The test3d (C++) and test3d_c (C) programs perform 3d FFTs and use
identical command-line arguments, as listed here.  The test3d_f90
(F90) program only currently supports the -h, -g, and -n options from
this list.  All of the 3d programs should produce identical numerical
results, and give very similar performance.

Here is an overview of the different command-line options.

The -g option is for the FFT grid size.

The -pin and -pout options determine how the FFT grid is partitioned
across processors before and after the FFT.

The -n option is the iteration count.

The -m option selects between full FFTs versus convolution FFTs.  For
full FFTs, a forward FFT returns data to its original decomposition.
Likewise for an inverse FFT.  For convolution FFTS, the data is left
in a z-pencil decomposition after a 3d forward FFT or a y-pencil
decomposition after a 2d forward FFT.  The inverse FFT starts from the
z- or y-pencil decomposition and returns the data to its original
decomposition.

The -i option determines how the values in the FFT grid are
initialized.

The -c option determines whether point2point or all2all communication
is performed when the FFT grid data is trasposed between sucessive 1d
FFTs.

The -e option is specified as pencil or brick.  For 3d FFTs with
pencil, there are 4 communication stages for a full FFT: brick ->
x-pencil -> y-pencil -> z-pencil -> brick.  Or 3 for a 3d convoultion
FFT (last stage is skipped).  Or 3 for a full 2d FFT (no z-pencil
decomposition).  Or 2 for a 2d convolution FFT.  For 3d FFTs with
brick, there are 6 communication stages for a full FFT: brick ->
x-pencil -> brick -> y-pencil -> brick -> z-pencil -> brick.  Or 5 for
a 3d convoultion FFT (last stage is skipped).  Or 4 for a full 2d FFT
(no z-pencil decomposition).  Or 3 for a 2d convolution FFT.

The -p option uses different low-level methods for packing
and unpacking FFT data this is sent as messages via MPI.

The -t option determines how much timing output is generated.

The -r option performs no 1d FFTs, it only moves the FFT
grid data between processors.

The -o option prints out grid values before and after the FFTs.
It should only be used for small grids, else the volume
of output can be immense.

The -v option verifies a correct result after a forward and inverse
FFT is performed.  The results for each grid point should be within
epsilon of the starting values.
