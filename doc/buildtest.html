<H3>Compiling the test programs 
</H3>
<P>The test directory has several programs that illustrate how to use the
Parallel FFT library and can also be used to benchmark its
performance.  These files invoke 3d FFTs.
</P>
<UL><LI>test3d.cpp : use the library as a C++ class
<LI>test3d_c.c : use the library thru its C interface
<LI>test3d_f90.f90 : use the library thru its Fortran interface 
</UL>
<P>And likewise for the test2d* files which invoke 2d FFTs.
</P>
<P>You can build all the test programs from the test directory, by
simply typing
</P>
<PRE>make 
</PRE>
<P>The standard Makefile uses mpicxx for compiling and linking the C++ and C
programs, and mpifort for the Fortran 90 programs.  If your MPI
installation does not include Fortran support, then you will not have
an mpifort and the Fortran test programs will not build.
</P>
<P>There are also several Makefile.machine files provided that work on
different machines.  You can use one of them or create your own edited
file and invoke it as
</P>
<PRE>make -f Makefile.machine 
</PRE>
<P>The resulting executables are
</P>
<UL><LI>C++: test3d and test2d
<LI>C: test3d_c and test2d_c
<LI>F90: test3d_f90 and test2d_f90 
</UL>
<P>You can build an individual test program by including its name as the
target, e.g.
</P>
<PRE>make test2d 
</PRE>
<P>As with the library, there are 2 options that can be set via the make
command, via the "fft" and/or "p" variables:
</P>
<PRE>make fft=FFT1d p=PRECISION 
</PRE>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: You must use the same values for these two variables
as were used when building the library in the src directory.  For the
"fft" variable this is to insure the build of the calling program
links to the appropriate 1d FFT library, e.g. FFTW2 or MKL.  For the
"p" variable this is to insure the single- or double-precision data
types used in the calling program for the FFT data match what the
library uses.  If you do not use the same variable settings,
compile-time errors or a run-time error message will be generated.
See additional comments in <A HREF = "#use">Using the library from your program</A>
for how to insure this consistency when using the library with your
program.
</P>
<P>NOTE: fft also needed when using C++ classes, to find the right
include file, so -I settings discussed above also needed??
</P>
<P>The Makefile assumes the directories for the respective 1d FFT
libraries are in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH, as defined in your environment.
These libraries are libfftw.a for FFTWs, libfftw3.a or libfftw3f.a for
double/single precision for FFTW3, libmkl_intel_lp64.a and
libmkl_sequential.a and libmkl_core.a for MKL built with the Intel
compiler, and libmkl_gf_lp64.a and libmkl_sequential.a and
libmkl_core.a for MKL built with the g++ compiler.  If the appropriate
library is not found, you will need to add a setting for the directory
to FFT_PATH in the Makefile, something like -L/home/me/lib.
