<H3>Optimization

<P>As noted above, communication cost in the FFTs can be minimized by
choosing appropriate input and output data layouts.  For both 2d and
3d FFTs an optimal input layout is one where each processor already
owns the entire fast-varying dimension of the data array and each
processor has (roughly) the same amount of data.  In this case, no
initial remapping of data is required; the first set of 1d FFTs can be
performed immediately.
</P>
<P>Similarly, an optimal output layout is one where each proc owns the
entire slow-varying dimension and again (roughly) the same amount of
data.  Additionally it is one where the permutation is specified as 1
for 2d and as 2 for 3d.  In this case, no final remapping of data is
required; the data is simple left in the layout used for the final set
of 1d FFTs.
</P>
<P>Note that these input and output layouts may or may not make sense for
a specific application.  But using either or both of them will reduce
the cost of the FFT operation.
