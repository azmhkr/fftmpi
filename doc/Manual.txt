Manual for the fftMPI library :c,h2

6 Mar 2018 version

The Parallel FFT library is designed to perform 2d and 3d
complex-to-complex Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) efficiently on
distributed-memory parallel computers using the message passing
interface (MPI) library.

The fftMPI library was developed by Steve Plimpton at Sandia National
Laboratories with help from several collaborators, listed below.
Sandia is a US Department of Energy facility, with funding from the
DOE through its Exascale Computing Program (ECP).  It is an
open-source code, distributed freely under the terms of the Lesser GNU

My thanks to Bruce Hendrickson and Sue Minkoff at Sandia for useful
discussions about parallel FFT strategies and to the FFTW authors for
the idea of using "plans" as an object-oriented tool for hiding FFT
and remap details from the user.
