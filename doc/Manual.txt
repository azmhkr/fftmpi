Manual for the fftMPI library :c,h2
10 Sep 2018 version :c,h4

The fftMPI library is designed to perform 2d or 3d complex-to-complex
Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) efficiently on distributed-memory
parallel machines using the message passing interface (MPI) library to
move data bewteen processors.

The fftMPI library was developed by Steve Plimpton at Sandia National
Laboratories with help from several collaborators, listed below.
Sandia is a US Department of Energy facility, with funding from the
DOE through its Exascale Computing Program (ECP).  The fftMPI library
is an open-source code, distributed freely under the terms of the
(BSD).  See the LICENSE file in the distribution.

My thanks to Bruce Hendrickson and Sue Minkoff at Sandia for useful
discussions about parallel FFT strategies and to the FFTW authors for
the idea of using "plans" as an object-oriented tool for hiding FFT
and remap details from the user.
