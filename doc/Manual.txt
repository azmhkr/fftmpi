Manual for the fftMPI library :c,h3
10 Sep 2018 version :c,h4

The fftMPI library is designed to perform parallel 2d or 3d
complex-to-complex Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) efficiently on
distributed-memory machines using the message passing interface (MPI)
library to move data bewteen processors.

The primary developer of the fftMPI library is "Steve Plimpton"_sjp at
Sandia National Laboratories, who can be contacted at sjplimp at
sandia.gov. Additional collaborators are listed on the "fftMPI
website"_fws.  Sandia is a US Department of Energy facility, with
funding from the DOE through its Exascale Computing Program (ECP).
The fftMPI library is an open-source code, distributed freely under
the terms of the (BSD).  See the LICENSE file in the distribution.

The fftMPI library replaces the older "Parallel FFT Package"_oldfft,
which I developed around 1997 for the "LAMMPS molecular dynamics
code"_http://lammps.sandia.gov.  The older package is also available
from this "download site"_download.

My thanks to Bruce Hendrickson and Sue Minkoff at Sandia for useful
discussions about parallel FFT strategies when I was creating the
original Parallel FFT Package.  Thanks also to the FFTW authors for
the idea of using "plans" as an object-oriented tool for hiding FFT
and data remapping details from the user.
