<H3>Syntax for calling the library from C 
</H3>
<P>These are the methods that can be called via the C interface to the
FFT3d class.  Those for the FFT2d class are identical, expect for the
setup() method, as indicated in the list.  See the test/test3d_c.c and
test/test2d_c.c files for examples of how all these methods are
called.
</P>
<PRE>void fft3d_create(MPI_Comm, int, void **ptr);
void fft3d_create_no_mpi(int, void **ptr);
void fft3d_destroy(void *ptr);
void fft3d_set(void *ptr, char *keyword, int value);
void fft3d_get(void *ptr, char *keyword, int *value);
void fft3d_setup(void *ptr, int, int, int,
                 int, int, int, int, int, int, int, int, int, int, int, int,
                 int, int *, int *, int *);
void fft2d_setup(void *ptr, int, int,
                 int, int, int, int, int, int, int, int,
                 int, int *, int *, int *);
void fft3d_setup_memory(void *ptr, FFT_SCALAR *, FFT_SCALAR *);
void fft3d_compute(void *ptr, FFT_SCALAR *, FFT_SCALAR *, int);
void fft3d_only_1d_ffts(void *ptr, FFT_SCALAR *, int);
void fft3d_only_remaps(void *ptr, FFT_SCALAR *, FFT_SCALAR *, int);
void fft3d_only_one_remap(void *ptr, FFT_SCALAR *, FFT_SCALAR *, int, int); 
</PRE>
<P>All these methods correspond one-to-one to the C++ class methods
described in the preceeding section.  See the discussion there for how
the different methods are used and details of their arguments.
</P>
<P>Note that the create() methods add a "void **ptr" argument which is
returned to the caller when an instance of the FFT3d or FFT2d class is
created within the library.  All the other methods return this "void
*ptr" argument to the library, so the class method can be invoked for
the proper class.  As with C++ instantiation, the caller can call
fft3d_create() multiple times to manage multiple flavors of FFTs, so
long as it keeps track of the set of returned pointers.
</P>
<P>The only other difference in this list of methods versus the C++
interface are the added fft3d_set() and fft3d_get() methods.  These
provide the functionality for setting (or querying) the 6 public
variables described in the preceeding section.  For example, they can
be invoked from the caller as follows to set or query various FFT
options.

fft3d_set(ptr,"exchange",1);
fft3d_set(ptr,"packflag",2);
